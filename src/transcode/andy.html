<div class=post>more proof that we&#39;re amnesiacs:<br /><br />&quot;The first step was, perhaps, the hardest: The Republican Party had to take an official and unanimous stand against the wisdom and constitutionality of the individual mandate. Typically, it’s not that difficult for the opposition party to oppose the least popular element in the majority party’s largest initiative. But the individual mandate was a policy idea Republicans had thought of in the late-1980s and supported for two decades. They had, in effect, to convince every Republican to say that the policy they had been supporting was an unconstitutional assault on liberty.&quot;<br /><br />[you should probably read it all.  And, if you&#39;re not cynical and want to participate in democracies, continue to REMEMBER THINGS]<br><hr><p><b>How Republicans made it possible for the Supreme Court to rule against the mandate</b></p>How Republicans made it possible for the Supreme Court to rule against the mandate<p><a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/06/25/why-the-supreme-court-might-rule-against-the-mandate/'>link</a></p></div>
