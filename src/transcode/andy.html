<div class=post>a) if you haven&#39;t seen district B13, do so.<br />b) don&#39;t debug shit in production people, seriously<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFAH3ZPhQ-E" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">we need an idea</a><br /><br />(This is a much better meme than the Downfall re-subs)</div>
<div class=post>Good.  And if you haven&#39;t read TNC&#39;s piece he&#39;s discussing, you should</div>
<div class=post>more proof that we&#39;re amnesiacs:<br /><br />&quot;The first step was, perhaps, the hardest: The Republican Party had to take an official and unanimous stand against the wisdom and constitutionality of the individual mandate. Typically, it’s not that difficult for the opposition party to oppose the least popular element in the majority party’s largest initiative. But the individual mandate was a policy idea Republicans had thought of in the late-1980s and supported for two decades. They had, in effect, to convince every Republican to say that the policy they had been supporting was an unconstitutional assault on liberty.&quot;<br /><br />[you should probably read it all.  And, if you&#39;re not cynical and want to participate in democracies, continue to REMEMBER THINGS]</div>
