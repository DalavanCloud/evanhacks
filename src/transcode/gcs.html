<div class=post><b>Happy Birthday!</b><br /><br />When we launched Google Consumer Surveys a year ago, we saw an opportunity to help publishers such as the NY Daily News, Los Angeles Times, Texas Tribune, San Jose Mercury and Reader’s Digest keep online content free for their users. During the past year, we have grown our publisher network to over 130 websites, including 3 of the top 10 newspapers in the US, and paid out millions of dollars to publishers — helping support the amazing content they create. In addition to work we have done with publishers, we have enabled businesses of all sizes to make data-driven decisions with the professional quality tools we&#39;ve built.<br /><br />We pledged to offer a fast, accurate and affordable way to conduct market research, and we’re please to say we’ve done just that. Over the course of a year we have learned a lot and continued to frequently launch new features such as tracking surveys, open ended responses, screening questions and cross-tabs. We have had 33 product updates, launched in the UK and Canada, created partnerships with reputable research firms <a href="http://goo.gl/GY0Ox" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">goo.gl/GY0Ox</a>, and had an endorsement by Nate Silver <a href="http://goo.gl/GZFAv" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">goo.gl/GZFAv</a>, the “high priest” of statistical polling data, for our work around the US Presidential election. It’s been quite the year! <br /><br />Today we want to say thank you to all the publishers and market researchers who have given us a chance and to all the non-researchers who thought they’d give research a try for the first time. It’s been a fun and busy year, but we aren’t done yet — we’re working on longer surveys, enabling mobile research and using surveys to improve products core to Google’s business. Happy researching!</div>

<div class=post><b>Copy Surveys</b><br />We recently moved the “copy” button to the survey homepage. You can find the button under the survey you want to run again. The “copy” button is only available for surveys that have completed running.<br /><br />If you do plan to copy the same survey and run it a few times you might consider using our tracking surveys that launched back in October. For example, if you are interested in tracking changes to consumer sentiment, you can set the survey frequency to biweekly or monthly during survey creation. Your survey will automatically run biweekly or monthly and you will get the visual component of a tracking survey where you can compare results from a tracking survey over time and clearly see how different events impact survey results.<br /><br />Enjoy!<p>Attachment: <a href='https://plus.google.com/photos/108089472890519702166/albums/5858249196949526417/5858249201869899794'>photo</a> [719x129]</p></div>
<div class=post><b>Our top 10 survey tips for researchers getting started with Google Consumer Surveys.</b><br /><br />1. Be brief and clear. Keep your questions short and simple. Answer choices should be meaningful, short, and exact.<br /><br />2. Be specific. Ask “How many times have you bought orange juice within the last 12 months?” instead of “Did you buy orange juice?”.<br /><br />3. Avoid jargon. Use familiar words instead of technical or industry terms.<br /><br />4. Avoid leading questions. Leading questions encourage respondents to answer in a particular way. <br /><br />5. Define the audience you’re interested in. If you only want answers from pet owners, start with a screening question such as “Do you own a dog or cat?” and then ask “How many times did you take your pet to the groomer last year?”<br /><br />6. Avoid &quot;No opinion&quot; or “I don’t know” answer options. The one exception is when you are actually interested in assessing how many people don’t know (e.g. for brand awareness tracking).<br /><br />7. Ask people what they think now, not what they thought at some point in the past or what they will think at some point in the future. Hypothetical questions are difficult to answer accurately.<br /><br />8. Avoid binary questions. Try to turn questions with two answers (e.g. agree/disagree, true/false, or yes/no) into a scale. For example, instead of “Do you agree or disagree with this statement: I like apples.” ask “How much do you like apples? and give respondents options from “Not at all” to “Very much.”<br /><br />9. Randomize answers. In a vertical list of multiple choice answers, people tend to click more on the top responses. Consumer Surveys randomizes multiple choice answers by default to reduce this effect. You can also randomly reverse the answer order if you want to maintain some order (e.g., ascending or descending numeric answers).<br /><br />10. One question, one answer. Create questions that can be answered one at a time with a single answer.</div>

<div class=post>Companies new to market research don’t always understand when they should use a screening question, so we thought we would share some additional details about this feature here. <br /><br /><b>What is a screening question?</b><br />Screening questions allow you to screen in or out respondents to ensure that you are surveying people in your target audience (e.g. “Do you own a car?” or “Do you shop at speciality food stores?”). Respondents will first see your screening question and then one of the other questions in your survey if they are a respondent you want to hear from.<br /><br /><b>When does it make sense to use a screening question?</b><br />You might not always want to survey a sample of the general internet population, sometimes all you care about is a sample of a specific group of people. For example, if you are creating a survey and asking everyone “How much did you pay for your car?” you only want to hear from people who own a car. Asking the screening question, “Do you own a car?” and showing the follow up question about the car cost to respondents who answer “Yes, I own a car” will enable you to address only the population that can answer your question. <br /><br /><b>Low Incidence Rate</b><br />One thing to keep in mind when using a screening question is the size of your target population. For example, if you only want to hear from people who own pink cars that were purchased in 1988 there aren’t many of those people and we would have a hard time finding them to survey. To make sure we can find the right people to answer your survey try to keep the population you are targeting at a decent size (over 5% of the general population).<br /><br />Take a look at an example survey using a screening question here: <a href="http://goo.gl/lYaLO" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/lYaLO</a><br><hr><p><b>Example Survey for Dog Toy Company</b> [<a href='https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=ew3o2uaw7vcq6'>link</a>]</p><p style='white-space: pre-wrap'>Example Survey for Dog Toy Company</p></div>
<div class=post>I just finished speaking at the IAB Leadership Meeting in Phoenix, sharing five ideas for how the ad world will look in the future, and announcing a few steps we’re taking today.<br /><br />I’ve worked on our advertising business at Google for over 10 years now, but the most interesting and dynamic times are yet to come. We are living in uncharted territory.  It’s a new kind of computing environment -- with more and more people excited about technology and spending a lot of time on devices, driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before.  It’s been a long time in computing since we have had this rate of change.<br /><br />With that in mind, here are the five ideas:<br /><br />Choice: We are moving rapidly to a choice-based economy, where users choose, with one click, what they see - both ads and content.  In years to come, most ad views will effectively become voluntary.<br /><br />Control: To be relevant in this world, our industry needs to keep investing in providing people with improved controls over the ads they see, so people can tell us what they do and don’t want to see.<br /><br />Charm: Emerging technologies and devices will finally help us make ads more interactive and beautiful at scale across all digital media.<br /><br />Connected: As people increasingly carry the web with them all day, across many screens, useful advertising formats and new ad models will emerge to help everyone live their lives on the go.<br /><br />Calibration: Metrics help the whole ecosystem do better - advertisers can optimize performance and better understand what is right for the user. We need to measure all advertising, and that involves developing standards beyond the click.<br /><br />As a step toward this future, I announced two new services we’re starting to roll out.<br /><br />Brand Lift: Surveys <br /><br />It’s still too hard for brands to measure the impact of their display and video campaigns, beyond simple metrics like clicks and impressions.  We’ve made a lot of headway in this area and we’re now starting to roll out surveys, to deliver a more effective way for marketers to easily measure the “brand lift” from their campaigns.  <br /><br />Advertisers will be able to run surveys to measure their display and video campaigns in AdWords, to better understand the impact of their ads in real-time. They can measure things like changes in the awareness of an upcoming movie, the recall of a new product name, intent to purchase a new cereal or the favorability of a particular brand. Businesses will be able to present consumers with an anonymous survey, to be shown days after they see an ad.  Responses will be aggregated (and compared to a control group). With these results, brands can calibrate and optimize their online ad campaigns quickly and seamlessly.  The rollout has started for marketers running video campaigns on YouTube and will be broadened to include display ad campaigns.<br /><br />The surveys are powered by Google Consumer Surveys, which is already helping lots of businesses conduct fast, accurate, &amp; affordable market research. (In fact, Nate Silver, of the New York Times’ FiveThirtyEight blog - concluded that Google Consumer Surveys was the #1 most accurate poll online and the #2 most accurate poll overall in last year’s Presidential election).  It’s also helping publishers like Los Angeles Times, Bloomberg, San Jose Mercury News and Boston.com earn revenues to fund their content, by showing surveys on their sites.<br /><br />TrueView in AdMob and games<br /><br />We’ve seen that a choice-based ad model can be very successful, with more than 70% of in-stream ads on YouTube now skippable. We’re now bringing the TrueView skippable format to mobile apps in AdMob and to online games that participate in the Google Display Network.  This extends the reach of TrueView campaigns, provides more revenue for our partners, and puts people in control of the ads they see. The beta will kick off next week with several partners including Activision, Gameloft, Kongregate, and Miniclip.<br /><br />I’m excited to work with others in the IAB, because advertising is crucial to funding content and services online.  As marketing and media move headlong into a digital future, our industry has a unique opportunity to build a future that helps drive our economy, and the web, forward.<br><hr><p><b>Overview</b> [<a href='http://www.iab.net/events_training/2013/alm/overview'>link</a>]</p><p style='white-space: pre-wrap'></p></div>
<div class=post><b>Inferred Demographics</b><br /><br />Companies new to market research are often interested in learning how Google Consumer Surveys gets the inferred demographics used to provide insights about respondents. We figured this might be a helpful piece of information for all of our researchers and wanted to share it here today.<br /><br />Demographic information is collected and inferred based on a respondent’s browsing history. The algorithm is the same method Google uses for advertising targeting, and uses significant indicators and patterns in order to determine gender &amp; age.  Google associates categories with a particular browser by looking at the types of Google Display Network sites visited and compares that information with aggregated survey data on site visitation. For example, if someone frequently visits sites that have a majority of female visitors, we may associate her browser&#39;s cookie with the “female” demographic category. The current available buckets Google Consumer Surveys uses include gender, age (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, and 45+), and region (North, Midwest, South, West).<br /><br />You can find the interests, demographic details, and other information that’s used to show you surveys by going to <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>. If you find that your information isn’t completely correct, feel free to update your interests so you see even more relevant content.<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://goo.gl/BJ8AP" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">goo.gl/BJ8AP</a> to see how this looks in action. You can always get an even more specific audience segment by using a screening question.</div>

<div class=post><b>More New Stuff - February</b><br /><br />In another update, we&#39;ve improved our reports for &quot;multiple answers&quot; questions.<br /><br />We added a &quot;reach table&quot; to highlight sets of answers selected by the largest number of unique respondents. This facilitates TURF analysis, a statistical technique for finding optimal subsets of choices. Imagine that you&#39;re creating a pet food commercial, and wondering where to film it. What would pet owners relate to? If you only have time for one location, shoot indoors and &quot;reach&quot; 58% of your target audience . Adding a backyard scene would boost your reach by 22.4 points to 80.4%, but a third scene in the park only adds 4.1 points, so it&#39;s probably not worth it.<br /><br />You can learn more about analyzing &quot;multiple answers&quot; in our new <b>Help Center article</b>. It explains how your answer percentages can add up to more than 100%, and describes the reach table in more detail:<br /><a href="http://support.google.com/consumersurveys/answer/2998498" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">http://support.google.com/consumersurveys/answer/2998498</a><p><i>Attachment unhandled: 'album'</i></p></div>
<div class=post><b>New Stuff - February</b><br /><br />In October 2012, we launched tracking surveys, which allow researchers to run the same survey at regular time intervals. For example, if you are interested in tracking monthly changes to consumer sentiment, you can set the survey frequency to monthly during survey creation. Your survey will automatically run once every month and the results will be easily viewable from your survey dashboard.<br /><br />Today, we are excited to announce the launch of the timeline -- the visual component of a tracking survey. You will be able to compare results from a tracking survey over time and see how different events impact survey results. The timeline is also an easy way to access a survey from a specific date -- just click on the date column in the timeline chart to see the data from that survey.<br /><br />You can see how the timeline works in these examples surveys -- <a href="http://goo.gl/zcZa0" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">goo.gl/zcZa0</a> &amp; <a href="http://goo.gl/VauqQ" class="ot-anchor" rel="nofollow">goo.gl/VauqQ</a> or in the images below. <p><i>Attachment unhandled: 'album'</i></p></div>

<div class=post><b>New Stuff - January</b><br /><br />The Google Consumer Surveys team has been hard at work on new features that we are excited to share with you today!<br /><br /><b>Compare by Screener Answer</b> <br />Researchers who flagged more than one target answer in a screener question will now be able cross-tab the screener question with any of their follow-up questions. For example, if you wanted to understand how dog ownership affected exercise behavior you could compare the answers of dog owners to those who are not dog owners. Just click “compare” under “Screening answer” to see the new chart. <br /><br /><b>Demographic and Screener Question Targeting</b><br />Previously, researchers could target respondents by demographics or with a screener question. Starting today, researchers will be able to target respondents by both. The combination of demographic targeting and a screener question will allow researchers to access lower incidence populations that they weren’t able to reach before.<br /><br /><b>Naming a Survey</b><br />In order to make the survey creation easier, we have removed the naming step from the creation flow. Researchers will still be able to give each survey a descriptive name on the “Confirm survey” page or even after the survey has started to collect results. <p><i>Attachment unhandled: 'album'</i></p></div>
