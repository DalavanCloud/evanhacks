During the past year, we have grown our publisher network to over 130 websites, including 3 of the top 10 newspapers in the US, and paid out millions of dollars to publishers — helping support the amazing content they create. In addition to work we have done with publishers, we have enabled businesses of all sizes to make data-driven decisions with the professional quality tools we&#39;ve built.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe pledged to offer a fast, accurate and affordable way to conduct market research, and we’re please to say we’ve done just that. Over the course of a year we have learned a lot and continued to frequently launch new features such as tracking surveys, open ended responses, screening questions and cross-tabs. We have had 33 product updates, launched in the UK and Canada, created partnerships with reputable research firms \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/GY0Ox\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egoo.gl/GY0Ox\u003c/a\u003e, and had an endorsement by Nate Silver \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/GZFAv\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egoo.gl/GZFAv\u003c/a\u003e, the “high priest” of statistical polling data, for our work around the US Presidential election. It’s been quite the year! \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday we want to say thank you to all the publishers and market researchers who have given us a chance and to all the non-researchers who thought they’d give research a try for the first time. It’s been a fun and busy year, but we aren’t done yet — we’re working on longer surveys, enabling mobile research and using surveys to improve products core to Google’s business. Happy researching!",

Ask “How many times have you bought orange juice within the last 12 months?” instead of “Did you buy orange juice?”.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e3. Avoid jargon. Use familiar words instead of technical or industry terms.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e4. Avoid leading questions. Leading questions encourage respondents to answer in a particular way. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e5. Define the audience you’re interested in. If you only want answers from pet owners, start with a screening question such as “Do you own a dog or cat?” and then ask “How many times did you take your pet to the groomer last year?”\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e6. Avoid &quot;No opinion&quot; or “I don’t know” answer options. The one exception is when you are actually interested in assessing how many people don’t know (e.g. for brand awareness tracking).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e7. Ask people what they think now, not what they thought at some point in the past or what they will think at some point in the future. Hypothetical questions are difficult to answer accurately.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e8. Avoid binary questions. Try to turn questions with two answers (e.g. agree/disagree, true/false, or yes/no) into a scale. For example, instead of “Do you agree or disagree with this statement: I like apples.” ask “How much do you like apples? and give respondents options from “Not at all” to “Very much.”\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e9. Randomize answers. In a vertical list of multiple choice answers, people tend to click more on the top responses. Consumer Surveys randomizes multiple choice answers by default to reduce this effect. You can also randomly reverse the answer order if you want to maintain some order (e.g., ascending or descending numeric answers).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e10. One question, one answer. Create questions that can be answered one at a time with a single answer.",

Respondents will first see your screening question and then one of the other questions in your survey if they are a respondent you want to hear from.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhen does it make sense to use a screening question?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou might not always want to survey a sample of the general internet population, sometimes all you care about is a sample of a specific group of people. For example, if you are creating a survey and asking everyone “How much did you pay for your car?” you only want to hear from people who own a car. Asking the screening question, “Do you own a car?” and showing the follow up question about the car cost to respondents who answer “Yes, I own a car” will enable you to address only the population that can answer your question. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eLow Incidence Rate\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne thing to keep in mind when using a screening question is the size of your target population. For example, if you only want to hear from people who own pink cars that were purchased in 1988 there aren’t many of those people and we would have a hard time finding them to survey. To make sure we can find the right people to answer your survey try to keep the population you are targeting at a decent size (over 5% of the general population).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTake a look at an example survey using a screening question here: \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/lYaLO\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://goo.gl/lYaLO\u003c/a\u003e",

We are living in uncharted territory.  It’s a new kind of computing environment -- with more and more people excited about technology and spending a lot of time on devices, driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before.  It’s been a long time in computing since we have had this rate of change.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith that in mind, here are the five ideas:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChoice: We are moving rapidly to a choice-based economy, where users choose, with one click, what they see - both ads and content.  In years to come, most ad views will effectively become voluntary.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eControl: To be relevant in this world, our industry needs to keep investing in providing people with improved controls over the ads they see, so people can tell us what they do and don’t want to see.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCharm: Emerging technologies and devices will finally help us make ads more interactive and beautiful at scale across all digital media.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eConnected: As people increasingly carry the web with them all day, across many screens, useful advertising formats and new ad models will emerge to help everyone live their lives on the go.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCalibration: Metrics help the whole ecosystem do better - advertisers can optimize performance and better understand what is right for the user. We need to measure all advertising, and that involves developing standards beyond the click.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs a step toward this future, I announced two new services we’re starting to roll out.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBrand Lift: Surveys \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt’s still too hard for brands to measure the impact of their display and video campaigns, beyond simple metrics like clicks and impressions.  We’ve made a lot of headway in this area and we’re now starting to roll out surveys, to deliver a more effective way for marketers to easily measure the “brand lift” from their campaigns.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAdvertisers will be able to run surveys to measure their display and video campaigns in AdWords, to better understand the impact of their ads in real-time. They can measure things like changes in the awareness of an upcoming movie, the recall of a new product name, intent to purchase a new cereal or the favorability of a particular brand. Businesses will be able to present consumers with an anonymous survey, to be shown days after they see an ad.  Responses will be aggregated (and compared to a control group). With these results, brands can calibrate and optimize their online ad campaigns quickly and seamlessly.  The rollout has started for marketers running video campaigns on YouTube and will be broadened to include display ad campaigns.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe surveys are powered by Google Consumer Surveys, which is already helping lots of businesses conduct fast, accurate, &amp; affordable market research. (In fact, Nate Silver, of the New York Times’ FiveThirtyEight blog - concluded that Google Consumer Surveys was the #1 most accurate poll online and the #2 most accurate poll overall in last year’s Presidential election).  It’s also helping publishers like Los Angeles Times, Bloomberg, San Jose Mercury News and Boston.com earn revenues to fund their content, by showing surveys on their sites.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTrueView in AdMob and games\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe’ve seen that a choice-based ad model can be very successful, with more than 70% of in-stream ads on YouTube now skippable. We’re now bringing the TrueView skippable format to mobile apps in AdMob and to online games that participate in the Google Display Network.  This extends the reach of TrueView campaigns, provides more revenue for our partners, and puts people in control of the ads they see. The beta will kick off next week with several partners including Activision, Gameloft, Kongregate, and Miniclip.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI’m excited to work with others in the IAB, because advertising is crucial to funding content and services online.  As marketing and media move headlong into a digital future, our industry has a unique opportunity to build a future that helps drive our economy, and the web, forward.",

We figured this might be a helpful piece of information for all of our researchers and wanted to share it here today.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDemographic information is collected and inferred based on a respondent’s browsing history. The algorithm is the same method Google uses for advertising targeting, and uses significant indicators and patterns in order to determine gender &amp; age.  Google associates categories with a particular browser by looking at the types of Google Display Network sites visited and compares that information with aggregated survey data on site visitation. For example, if someone frequently visits sites that have a majority of female visitors, we may associate her browser&#39;s cookie with the “female” demographic category. The current available buckets Google Consumer Surveys uses include gender, age (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, and 45+), and region (North, Midwest, South, West).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou can find the interests, demographic details, and other information that’s used to show you surveys by going to \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/ads/preferences\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.google.com/ads/preferences\u003c/a\u003e. If you find that your information isn’t completely correct, feel free to update your interests so you see even more relevant content.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCheck out \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/BJ8AP\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egoo.gl/BJ8AP\u003c/a\u003e to see how this looks in action.
